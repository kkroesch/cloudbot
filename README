====== Command Line Toolkit ======

===== Introduction =====

This is the Command Line Toolkit. It was intended as a plug-in to a consisting Java server application that has a command-line maintenance interface. While development was going on, I added an IRC library to be able to control several nodes by sending them all the same command.

===== Build =====

Since the project is built with Apache Maven, it can be compiled and started with ''mvn compile''.

To start the CloudBot, simply execute 
''mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="de.kroesch.clt.net.CloudBot"''
